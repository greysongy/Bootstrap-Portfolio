### Technologies Used:

html, css, Javascript, Google Fonts

#### Additional Notes: 

The contact page didn't need the grid system/resizing, since it's components always fit on the page. 

The portfolio page resizes at three break points (small, medium, and large), each time effectively moving one image to a lower row. 

The about page has one break point, which moves the image below the text body.
